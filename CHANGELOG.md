## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] — 2026-09-16

A public **live demo**, a **first-run setup wizard** for self-hosters,
**GitHub-template** conversion, and a README **screenshot gallery** populated
with eight screens from the live demo. No schema migrations, and production
behavior is unchanged — every demo and setup path is independently gated.

### Added
- **Live demo.** A public, shared, read-mostly demo instance (`pulse-demo`) runs the same codebase behind a `DEMO_MODE` flag: every visitor is auto-signed-in as a shared demo user over realistic seeded data (no login/signup), AI runs on canned responses (no quota used), ingest/push/export are disabled, and a 4-hour cron wipes + reseeds. Its D1/R2 are isolated from production, and every destructive path independently checks `DEMO_MODE`, so production is untouched. Linked from the README. ([496bbf2](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/496bbf2))
- **First-run setup wizard.** A freshly deployed instance routes every request to a `/setup` wizard until an owner account exists in D1, so a new self-hoster's first action is creating their account — not editing files or running commands. Steps: welcome → create account (email magic-link) → verify the Groq key actually works (a real pass/fail check) → optional email auto-import → done, then into the app. The gate is enforced in middleware from the `user` table (not a cookie), so a deep link can't slip past it, and it never reappears once an owner exists. ([a8623aa](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/a8623aa))

### Changed
- Converted the repository to a **GitHub template** — visitors can click "Use this template" to create their own independent copy. Docs (README, SELF-HOSTING, CLAUDE.md) now lead the "get your own copy" path with the template step, complementing the existing one-click deploy and manual paths. ([1c45cb1](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/1c45cb1))
- **README:** added the Pulse logo to the hero and a **Screenshots gallery** — eight screens (capture · money · tasks · learn · notes · habits · analytics · assistant) captured from the live demo and shown expanded near the top, with a capture guide in `docs/screenshots/`. ([02a805d](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/02a805d))

## [1.2.0] — 2026-09-16

One-click "Deploy to Cloudflare" with automatic D1 migrations, two security
sweeps (Dependabot + CodeQL), a crash fix and a scaling fix, render-performance
memoizations, and a bundle-measurement tool. Each change shipped to production
behind the CI + Cloudflare deploy pipeline on merge to `main`.

### Added
- **One-click "Deploy to Cloudflare" button** with **automatic D1 migrations on every deploy** (first and subsequent). The button provisions a fresh, isolated D1 database and R2 bucket in the visitor's own Cloudflare account, prompts for secrets, runs the migrations, and deploys. Implemented via an id-less `wrangler.toml` template plus a `wrangler.prod.toml` for CI, a `deploy` npm script that runs `wrangler d1 migrations apply` before `wrangler deploy`, `.dev.vars.example` for secret prompting, and a `cloudflare.bindings` help block. CI now validates every migration against an ephemeral local D1. ([ac49752](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/ac49752))
- **`pnpm bundle:report`** — a dev tool that measures per-route First Load JS (gzip transfer size, split into framework / polyfill / app code) from the real build output, since Turbopack prints no size table. ([5233e4c](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/5233e4c))

### Changed
- **Performance:** memoized hot render paths — the habits dashboard widget's per-habit streak computation, global search, and the notes/learning list filter+sort. ([e4e92b4](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/e4e92b4))
- **Docs:** README refreshed to cover one-click deploy, auto-detect-account on alert imports, SMS auto-ingest, and manual exchange-rate overrides. ([17bda58](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/17bda58))

### Fixed
- **Crash on tag-filtered learning/notes with legacy or imported rows.** A learning/note row synced or imported without a `tags` field would crash the page when filtered by tag; all tag paths (filters, lists, query-exec) are now guarded with `(tags ?? [])`, with regression tests. ([e4e92b4](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/e4e92b4))
- **`/api/fx/rates` could 500 on many currencies.** The `targets` query parameter was uncapped and could exceed Cloudflare D1's 100-bound-parameter limit; the `IN` query is now chunked to ≤90. ([e4e92b4](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/e4e92b4))

### Security
- **Cleared 11 Dependabot alerts** (4 critical, 2 high, 5 moderate): `next` + `eslint-config-next` `16.2.11 → 16.3.5` (two critical advisories), `vitest` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` `→ 4.1.11`, and transitive floors for `browserslist`, `qs`, and `baseline-browser-mapping`. ([9644522](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/9644522))
- **CodeQL:** added least-privilege `permissions: contents: read` to the CI workflow, clearing a medium "workflow does not contain permissions" finding. ([e4e92b4](https://github.com/sheikahamed17/pulse/commit/e4e92b4))

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-15

domain, plus two production fixes (sync-500 on large backlogs; money add-form
crash). Schema migrations `0023 → 0026`. Test suite at 1,257.
